# About
This was a project for the course 'Programming 3' in 2019. The task was to develop a board game ontop of a simple template provided by the course staff. The course side of the implementation is included in 'course/'. The rest of the project was implemented by us. 

# How to play
Instructions on how to play (only in finnish) are found under 'dokumentaatio/'.
